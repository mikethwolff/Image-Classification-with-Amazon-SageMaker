# Image Classification with AWS SageMaker

Task: Train a pretrained model that can perform image classification by using the AWS Sagemaker profiling, debugger, hyperparameter tuning and other ML engineering practices.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the setup of an ML infrastructure that can facilitate the training of accurate models. It's not just about achieving high accuracy but about understanding and implementing the end-to-end process that makes ML development sustainable, scalable, and efficient. We will use a pretrained image classification model to classify the dog breed, given an image of the dog. This will be done by loading the pretrained model then using transfer learning we adapt the model to the dog breed classification dataset.

## Project Set Up and Installation
Enter AWS  and open SageMaker Studio. Download the starter files. Download/Make the dataset available.

## Dataset

### Overview
**TODO**: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Access
**TODO**: Explain how you are accessing the data in AWS and how you uploaded it

## Hyperparameter Tuning
**TODO**: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search

Remember that your README should:
- Include a screenshot of completed training jobs
- Logs metrics during the training process
- Tune at least two hyperparameters
- Retrieve the best best hyperparameters from all your training jobs

## Debugging and Profiling
**TODO**: Give an overview of how you performed model debugging and profiling in Sagemaker

### Results
**TODO**: What are the results/insights did you get by profiling/debugging your model?

**TODO** Remember to provide the profiler html/pdf file in your submission.


## Model Deployment
**TODO**: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

**TODO** Remember to provide a screenshot of the deployed active endpoint in Sagemaker.

## Standout Suggestions
**TODO (Optional):** This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
